/**
 * Each method in this class corresponds to a route that is called by the H5P
 * client. Normally, the implementation must call them and send back the
 * return values as a JSON body in the HTTP response.
 *
 * If something goes wrong, the methods throw H5pErrors, which include HTTP
 * status codes. Send back these status codes in your HTTP response.
 *
 * Remarks:
 * - Most of the route names can be configured in the IH5PConfig object and thus
 *   might have different names in your case!
 * - The GET /content/<contentId>/<file> and GET /temp-files/<file> routes
 *   should support partials for the Interactive Video editor to work. This
 *   means that the response with HTTP 200 must send back the header
 *   'Accept-Ranges: bytes' and must send back status code 206 for partials.
 *   Check out the documentation of the methods `getContentFile` and
 *   `getTemporaryFile` for more details.
